# Authentication

At this time, the ActivityInfo API supports Basic Authentication, a standard method of authentication 
supported by most HTTP Clients.

When authenticating to activityinfo.org, clients should submit an authorized userâ€™s email and password as the 
username and password. Be sure to submit the requests over HTTPS to avoid sending plaintext passwords over the wire.
