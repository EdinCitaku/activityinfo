# Introduction

The ActivityInfo API allows you to query and update public and private ActivityInfo databases. 
You can also push updates to ActivityInfo databases for which you have write permissions.

ActivityInfo offers a JSON-based API that mostly follows RESTful principles, so 
you can either use your favorite REST client library to send and receive JSON, 
or you can use a client library for R or Python for convenience.
