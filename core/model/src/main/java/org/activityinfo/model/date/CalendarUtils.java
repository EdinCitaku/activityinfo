/**
 * The first epi week of the year ends, by definition, on the first Saturday of January,
 * as long as it falls at least four days into the month. Each epi week begins on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday.
 * <p/>
 * http://www.cmmcp.org/epiweek.htm
 * <p/>
 * MMWR week numbering is sequential beginning with 1 and incrementing with each week to a maximum of 52 or 53.
 * MMWR week #1 of an MMWR year is the first week of the year that has at least four days in the calendar year.
 * For example, if January 1 occurs on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, the calendar week that includes January 1 would be
 * MMWR week #1. If January 1 occurs on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, the calendar week that includes January 1 would be the last
 * MMWR week of the previous year (#52 or #53). Because of this rule, December 29, 30, and 31 could potentially fall into
 * MMWR week #1 of the following MMWR year.
