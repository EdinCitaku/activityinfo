/**
 * ActivityInfo is, at it's core, concerned with the management of users' `Resource`s.
 *
 * Our users need to manage a variety of `Resource`s, from form definitions (`FormClass`es) to results
 * submitted by other users (`FormInstance`s), to a diverse set of report models, access control rules, etc.
 *
 * All these "things" we will consider to be "resources", which have a stable, globally unique
 * identity, a version, and owner.
 *
 * The owner of a resource is another may be an individual user, a group of users, or another resource from
 * which access control rules will be inherited. Users and user groups may be also be modelled as
 * resources, so we can say that every `Resource` is owned by another `Resource`; except the root resource.
 *
 * As a `Resource` can have exactly one owner, resources form a tree structure that we will
 * present to the user as a sort-of folder structure.
 *
 * Resources have zero or more, named properties.
