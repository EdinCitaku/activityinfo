# Geoadmin

The GeoAdmin tool is a Java Swing application
built to facilitate maintenance of ActivityInfo's geographic
reference data sets. 

It provides a sophisticated user-assisted automatic merging function
used to update existing administrative layers with new shapefiles.

Ultimately the goal is to mere this functionality into the web 
application so that it can be used for all forms, not just 
those in geographic reference database.
